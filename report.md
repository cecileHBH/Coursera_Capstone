# Predicting the severity of a car accident


## Introduction

The number of annual road traffic deaths has reached 1.35 million worldwide[^1]. Road traffic injuries are the first cause of death of people aged 5-29 years. Every 24 seconds someone dies on the road. Those numbers are astonishingly high but there is another cost of these accidents : the medical costs for the survivors. Injured people often need medical care wheareas for short or long term injuries. The economic consequences of motor vehicle crashes have been estimated between 1% and 3% of the respective GNP of the world countries, reaching a total over $500 billion [^2]

This project aims to determine if we can predict the severity of a car accident using features as date, time, location, weather conditions and road conditions.

### Interests

If such a prediction is possible, we may be able to find a correlation between the severity and a specific feature which could lead to improve the roads safety. Addressing this problem the right way, whereas it is prevention messages, adding traffic signage or redesigning roads would mean less road traffic injuries and less money spent on medical care. For a government or local authority taking care of the medical bill, it means they could spend this budget for other purposes.

## Data

### Data source

The dataset used is the US Accidents (3.5 million records)[^3] dataset from Kaggle.

### Description

This dataset contains accident data covering 49 states of the USA. It has been collected from February 2016 and June 2020 using multiple Traffic APIs. It contains features as start and end time, location, weather conditions and road conditions
